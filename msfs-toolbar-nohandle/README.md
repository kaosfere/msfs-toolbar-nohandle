# msfs-toolbar-nohandle

This is a quick mode to remove the toolbar "handle" from the in-flight view in MSFS when the mouse moves.  It's an enhancement of an earlier mod meant to make it work for game version 1.8.3.0 and also serve as a demonstration of improved techniques for limited-scope modding.
